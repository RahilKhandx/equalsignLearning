                    <h2 class="title">Our Leading Principles</h2>
                    <div class="blog-desc">
                        <p><strong>Impatient for Action rather than Results: </strong><br>Equalsign teachers aren't afraid to take action and make changes. We are impatient for action but not for results. We understand that if the basics are strong and ongoing action is taken to improve, the results will follow. The grade will be taken care of automatically.</p>

                        <p><strong>The "comma" is when obsession begins:</strong><br>Our teachers are focused on doing not only the large things right, but also the little things right. How do we respond to emails? How should we write? How do we communicate with our teachers? Do we point out when a comma is incorrectly placed? Yes. Our teachers are the ones who do it.</p>

                        <p><strong>Unlearning and Learning:</strong><br>Just like the students, Equalsign is also always learning and improving. We understand that unlearning is just as vital as learning. We recognize that mastery is a journey rather than a destination.</p>

                        <p><strong>Transparently Open:</strong><br>JEqualsign is open and honest with their teams about the numbers. In terms of the good and the bad. Information is not hidden. It is openly communicated to all.</p>

                        <p><strong>Leaders develop Leaders:</strong><br>Our experienced teachers must empower and produce more like them. That is accomplished by encouraging students, enabling them, energizing them, not favoring any of them, and always assisting them in learning.</p>
